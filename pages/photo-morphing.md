            Morphing of photographs of your nose is an essential part of the Prof Sama’s consultation process and a key tool for effective communication. Lots of individuals struggle to visualise what their surgical outcome may look like. They are often fixated on the most obvious deformity (like the hump) or have misconceptions of what changes they would like based on images they have seen on social media and internet. Using computer software, your pre-surgery images are amended to present realistic outcomes that could be achieved with surgery. The images are presented and sequenced to allow you to understand the different changes that are planned or can be considered. These images are not a guarantee of result, but a tool to assist communication and understanding.

            This allows you to 
            <ul>
            <li>Visualise what changes can be made </li>
            <li>Understanding of the realistic outcomes of surgery for you and your concerns</li>
            <li>Understanding of how small sequence of changes results in a greater overall improvement</li>
            <li>Involvement in the decision making of the changes to be considered</li>
            <li>Understanding of the degree of change that can be made with different approaches and techniques- e.g., Open vs Closed Rhinoplasty in reduction of tip projection</li>
            <li>Eliminate misconceptions acquired from social media and internet</li>

            These Morphed images are shared with you via email to give you adequate time for consideration and consultation with trusted family and friends.

            <br>
            Prof Sama will show you images of the morphed planned outcome and the final outcome of previous patients who have had surgery with him. This will give you a prospective on the degree of variation that may occur between the planned morphed images and the real surgical outcome.
