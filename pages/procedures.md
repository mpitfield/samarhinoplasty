            The Nose is the most dominant and defining feature of the face. A nose with cosmetic blemishes can bring imbalance and disharmony to the face. The Role of Rhinoplasty surgery is to address these imperfections to create aesthetic balance and bring harmony to the face.

        <h4>Functional Nasal surgery : Septorhinoplasty</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            Some individuals will seek surgery because they have both functional (difficulty breathing through the nose) and aesthetic aspirations. There is limited benefit in having surgery to have an attractive looking nose if it doesn’t function well! Nasal aesthetics and breathing are both an equally important part of any Rhinoplasty procedure.   
            <br><br>
            The commonest causes for nasal functional restriction are a septal deviation, large inferior turbinates and fractured deviated nose. 
            <br><br>
            Deviated Septum: Nasal septal deviation is commonly due to previous nasal injury but can also be there since birth or part of the facial development.   
            <br><br>
            Enlarged Turbinates: Turbinate enlargement can be secondary to nasal septal deviations or nasal allergies. These structural problems need to be  
            <br><br>
            Nasal bone fractures and deviations: Previous nasal injuries can result in change in the alignment and positioning of the nasal bones that can compromise nasal breathing

            To achieve these changes, there are classically two approaches: Closed and Open Rhinoplasty 
            <br><br>
            Closed or Open Rhinoplasty are not different “operations”. They are simply the most suitable approach (access) used to deliver on the changes required. Prof Sama uses both Closed and Open approaches.  
            <br><br>
            Closed Rhinoplasty: 
            <ul>
                <li>All incision made inside the nose</li>
                <li>Less invasive and the skin structure over the nose is better protected</li>
                <li>Quicker recovery and healing</li>
                <li>Can be used to address</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The hump and change profile</li>
                    <li>Improve the tip shape and definition</li>
                    <li>Improve nasal breathing</li>
                    <li>Change the rotation of the tip up or down</li>
                    <li>Improve breathing by correcting septum and/or turbinates</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            Open Rhinoplasty
            <ul>
                <li>Involves a cut between the nostrils of the nose</li>
                <li>More traumatic in the long term for the skin envelope</li>
                <li>Longer healing and settling time for the nose</li>
                <li>Is used to make all the changes achievable through closed but additionally</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce the length and projection of nose</li>
                    <li>Notably change the shape of the tip</li>
                    <li>Reconstruct the nose and improve breathing</li>
                    <li>Revision surgery</li> 
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            Revision Rhinoplasty 
            <ul>
                <li>May require an open or closed approach </li>
                <li>Key is to address the residual abnormalities or deformity resultant from previous surgery </li>
                <li>May require a localised approach and procedure, or significant reconstruction </li>
            </ul>
