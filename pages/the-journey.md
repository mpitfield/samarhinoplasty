        <p>
            Undergoing Rhinoplasty can be a challenging decision. My role as the surgeon is to understand, inform and support you through this process. Your journey can be broken down into three stages- Consultation, Surgery and Aftercare.  
            <br>
            <br>
            At all stages you will be seen by Prof Sama.
